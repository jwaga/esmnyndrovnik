      <h3>East Side Mandala is a project which aims at acquiring a place for a Buddhist centre in Lublin. </h3>
<p>The acquisition of the centre will allow a greater number of people to come into contact with the Buddhist teachings and benefit from their richness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After years of renting places we would like to purchase a property to create a Buddhist centre so that our activity could be steadily continued in the future. Our activities are financed from the membership fees and donations transferred to our account or received during the lectures, courses and other events.</p>
<p>We plan to establish an open Buddhist library and gallery of art in the centre.</p>
<p>The East Side Mandala project is based on the cooperation of many people from Zamość, Radzyń Podlaski, Kraśnik and Chełm, and, of course, Lublin. That is why this project is called East Side Madala – a mandala which consists of the towns and cities of the Eastern Poland. The involvement of friends from all over the Lubelskie region is an undeniable asset of the project.</p>
<p>We are open for any possibility of acquring a building which we could adopt for the needs of a Buddhist meditation centre. We are willing to repair and renovate a historic building as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We wish to acquire a property by collecting small, regular payments from as many friends. </p>
<p>You can support the project by creating a standing order of 10zł 80gr or more to the account below.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
